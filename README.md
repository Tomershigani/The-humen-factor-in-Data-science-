# The humen factor in Data science
In this project, we conducted an online questionnaire among 70 male and female participants in the age range of 20-40 to
investigate whether there is a connection between belief in stereotypes about the LGBTQ community and homophobia.
We tested both positive and negative stereotypes, such as the belief that "partners in gay and lesbian relationships are less happy than partners in straight relationships" 
and the belief that "gays and lesbians are more artistic than straight people." We also asked questions about
homophobia, such as "homosexuality is immoral."

Using Python, we analyzed the results of the questionnaire, assigning each participant a grade that ranked their degree of belief in negative
stereotypes, degree of belief in positive stereotypes, and homophobia rank. We then used statistical methods such as linear regression to explore the correlations between these factors.

This project highlights the importance of considering the human factor in data science, particularly when it comes to issues of bias and
discrimination. By examining the beliefs and attitudes of participants, we gain a better understanding of the social and cultural factors
that can influence data analysis and interpretation.
